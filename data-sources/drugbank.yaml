license-commentary:
  - 'There is also an open (CC0) data subset for vocabulary and structures that could be evaluated separately; it is ~5mb vs ~150mb for the complete "academic" set(about 3%).'
  - 'This seems to be mostly a standard NC/commercial licensing split, with DrugBank+ supporting commerical licensing for fees.'
  - 'To download the full academic set, one must create an account (https://go.drugbank.com/public_users/sign_up), which is a multi-step and human mediated process, with varying turnaround times and follow-up questions.'
