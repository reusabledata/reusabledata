    comment: 'While the download method is fine, to get at all of the available data in TSV, one would have to click through on over a hundred different links through the UI; there is also the "hidden" https://www.bgee.org/ftp/current/ , but it is not conducive to crawling in my estimation. There are also supposed to be dumps at /download/data-dumps, but the two links there are 404.'
license-commentary:
  - 'In footer, two download pages are given in the footer (/download/processed-expression-values and /download/gene-expression-calls) and a third in the menu (/download/data-dumps); on all of these pages we see "All data are available under the Creative Commons Zero license (CC0)."'
  - 'Also noting that on /about/, there is similarly affirming text.'
  - 'A little unclear on how this practically interacts with the sources list on /about/sources, but does not affect evaluation with current standards.'
