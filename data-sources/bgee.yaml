license-commentary:
  - 'In footer, two download pages are given in the footer (/download/processed-expression-values and /download/gene-expression-calls) and a third in the menu (/download/data-dumps); on all of these pages we see "All data are available under the Creative Commons Zero license (CC0)."'
  - 'Also noting that on /about/, there is similarly affirming text.'
  - 'A little unclear on how this practically interacts with the sources list on /about/sources, but does not affect evaluation with current standards.'
  - 'While there is manual iteration needed for the TSVs, the mysql and rdf available on the data-dumps page sufficiently bridges the bulk criteria in C.1.'
